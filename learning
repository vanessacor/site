This was my first web page. I started learning how to code following some tutorials but that didn't quite work so I stumble upon the Odin Project and all started to make sense to me. The Odin starts with the basic of the basics. I went through the first modules and on the fourth I managed to do this. I've learnt how to structure Html and how to do the basic styles with css. 


Here I expanded further my knowledge of styling specificly how to make a responsive layout. 


This was my practice on creating a webpage with more content and also my first JavaScript function :-)

Here are javaScripts exercises. The Rock paper scissors was part of the Odin project.

I took the project a bit further and made some improvements.

This my attemptive to create a landing page. Here I wanted to practice my html/css skills
