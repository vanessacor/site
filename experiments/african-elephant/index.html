                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p><strong>African elephants</strong> are elephants of 
                        the genus <i>Loxodonta</i>. The genus consists of two extant species:
                        the <strong>African bush elephant</strong>, <i>L. africana</i>, and 
                        the smaller African forest elephant, <i>L. cyclotis. Loxodonta</i> is 
                        one of two existing genera of the family Elephantidae. Fossil remains of 
                        Loxodonta have been found only in Africa, in strata as old as the middle 
                        Pliocene. However, sequence analysis of DNA extracted from fossils of the 
                        extinct straight-tusked elephant undermines the validity of the genus.

                    <h3>Physiology</h3>
                    <img src="images/image2.jpg" alt="elephant-feet">
                    <p>One species of African elephant, the bush 
                        elephant, is the largest living terrestrial animal, while 
                        the forest elephant is the third-largest. Their thickset 
                        bodies rest on stocky legs, and they have concave backs.
                        Their large ears enable heat loss. The upper lip and 
                        nose form a trunk. The trunk acts as a fifth limb, a sound 
                        amplifier, and an important method of touch. African elephants'
                        trunks end in two opposing lips, whereas the Asian elephant
                        trunk ends in a single lip. In L. africana, males stand 
                        3.2–4.0 m tall at the shoulder and weigh 4,700–6,048 kg, while 
                        females stand 2.2–2.6 m tall and weigh 2,160–3,232 kg. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Teeth</h4>
                    <p>Elephants have four molars; each weighs about 5 kg (11 lb) and 
                        measures about 30 cm (12 in) long. As the front pair wears down 
                        and drops out in pieces, the back pair 
                        moves forward, and two new molars emerge in the back of the 
                        mouth. Elephants replace their teeth four to six times in their 
                        lifetimes. Around 40 to 60 years of age, the elephant loses the 
                        last of its molars and will likely die of starvation, a common 
                        cause of death. African elephants have 24 teeth in total, six on 
                        each quadrant of the jaw. The enamel plates of the molars are 
                        fewer in number than in Asian elephants.
                    </p>
                    <p>The elephants' tusks are firm teeth; the second set of incisors 
                        become the tusks. They are used for digging for roots and stripping 
                        the bark from trees for food, for fighting each other during mating 
                        season, and for defending themselves against predators. The tusks 
                        weigh from 23–45 kg and can be from 1.5–2.4 m long. Unlike Asian 
                        elephants, both male and female African elephants have tusks. They 
                        are curved forward and continue to grow throughout the elephant's 
                        lifetime.

                    <img src="images/image3.jpg" alt="africa">
                    <p>African elephants are found widely in Sub-Saharan 
                        Africa, in dense forests, mopane and miombo woodlands, Sahelian 
                        scrub, or deserts.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section class="content" id="behaviour">
                    <h3>Behaviour</h3>
                    <img src="images/image4.jpg" alt="elephants">
                    <p>African elephant societies are arranged around family units. 
                        Each family unit is made up of around ten closely related 
                        females and their calves and is led by an older female known as 
                        the matriarch. When separate family units bond, they form 
                        kinship or bond groups. After puberty, male elephants tend to 
                        form close alliances with other males.
                    </p>
                    <p>Elephants are at their most fertile between the ages of 25 and 45. 
                        Calves are born after a gestation period of up to nearly two 
                        years. The calves are cared for by their mother and other young 
                        females in the group, known as allomothers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Elephants use some vocalisations that are beyond the hearing range of 
                        humans, to communicate across large distances. Elephant mating 
                        rituals include the gentle entwining of trunks.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Feeding</h4>
                    <p>While feeding, elephants use their trunks to pluck at leaves and 
                        their tusks to tear at branches, which can cause enormous damage to 
                        foliage. A herd may deplete an area of foliage depriving other 
                        herbivores for a time. African elephants may eat up to 450 kg 
                        of vegetation per day, although their digestive system is 
                        not very efficient; only 40% of this food is properly digested. The 
                        foregut fermentation used by ruminants is generally considered more 
                        efficient than the hindgut fermentation employed by proboscideans 
                        and perissodactyls; however, the ability to process food more 
                        rapidly than foregut fermenters gives hindgut fermenters an advantage 
                        at very large body size, as they are able to accommodate significantly 
                        larger food intakes.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Intelligence</h4>
                    <p>African elephants are highly intelligent, and they have a very large 
                        and highly convoluted neocortex, a trait they share with humans, 
                        apes and some dolphin species. They are amongst the world's most 
                        intelligent species. With a mass of just over 5 kg (11 lb), elephant 
                        brains are larger than those of any other land animal, and although the 
                        largest whales have body masses twentyfold those of a typical elephant, 
                        whale brains are barely twice the mass of an elephant's brain. The 
                        elephant's brain is similar to that of humans in terms of structure and 
                        complexity. For example, the elephant's cortex has as many neurons as 
                        that of a human brain,suggesting convergent evolution.
                    </p>
                    <p>Elephants exhibit a wide variety of behaviors, including those 
                        associated with grief, learning, allomothering, mimicry, art, play, 
                        a sense of humor, altruism, use of tools, compassion, cooperation, 
                        self-awareness, memory and possibly language. All point to a highly 
                        intelligent species that is thought to be equal with cetaceans, and 
                        primates.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Reproduction</h4>
                    <img src="images/image5.jpg" alt="mum_and_cub">
                    <p>African elephants show sexual dimorphism in weight and shoulder 
                        height by age 20, due to the rapid early growth of males. By age 25, 
                        males are double the weight of females; however, both sexes continue 
                        to grow throughout their lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>Female African elephants are able to start reproducing at around 10 
                        to 12 years of age, and are in estrus for about 2 to 7 days. They do 
                        not mate at a specific time; however, they are less likely to 
                        reproduce in times of drought than when water is plentiful. The 
                        gestation period of an elephant is 22 months and fertile females 
                        usually give birth every 3 – 6 years, so if they live to around 50 
                        years of age, they may produce 7 offspring. Females are a scarce 
                        and mobile resource for the males so there is intense competition 
                        to gain access to estrous females.
                    </p>
                    <p>Post sexual maturity, males begin to experience musth, a physical and 
                        behavioral condition that is characterized by elevated testosterone, 
                        aggression and more sexual activity. Musth also serves a purpose of 
                        calling attention to the females that they are of good quality, and 
                        it cannot be mimicked as certain calls or noises may be. Males sire 
                        few offspring in periods when they are not in musth. During the 
                        middle of estrus, female elephants look for males in musth to guard 
                        them. The females will yell, in a loud, low way to attract males 
                        from far away. Male elephants can also smell the hormones of a 
                        female ready for breeding. This leads males to compete with each 
                        other to mate, which results in the females mating with older, 
                        healthier males. Females choose to a point who they mate with, 
                        since they are the ones who try to get males to compete to guard 
                        them. However, females are not guarded in the early and late stages 
                        of estrus, which may permit mating by younger males not in musth.
                    </p>
                    <p>Males over the age of 25 compete strongly for females in estrous, 
                        and are more successful the larger and more aggressive they are. 
                        Bigger males tend to sire bigger offspring. Wild males begin 
                        breeding in their thirties when they are at a size and weight that 
                        is competitive with other adult males. Male reproductive success is 
                        maximal in mid-adulthood and then begins to decline. However, this 
                        can depend on the ranking of the male within their group, as 
                        higher-ranking males maintain a higher rate of reproduction. Most 
                        observed matings are by males in musth over 35 years of age. 
                        Twenty-two long observations showed that age and musth are extremely 
                        important factors; "… older males had markedly elevated paternity 
                        success compared with younger males, suggesting the possibility of 
                        sexual selection for longevity in this species." (Hollister-Smith, 
                        et al. 287)
                    </p>
                    <p>Males usually stay with a female and her herd for about a month 
                        before moving on in search for another mate. Less than a third of 
                        the population of female elephants will be in estrus at any given 
                        time and gestation period of an elephant is long, so it makes more 
                        evolutionary sense for a male to search for as many females as 
                        possible rather than stay with one group.

                    <p>During the 20th century, poaching significantly reduced the 
                        population of Loxodonta in some regions. The World Wide Fund for 
                        Nature believes there were between 3 and 5 million African elephants 
                        as recently as the 1930s and 1940s. Between 1980 and 1990 the 
                        population of African elephants was more than halved, from 1.3 
                        million to around 600,000. Between 1973 and 1989, the African 
                        elephant population of Kenya declined by 85%. In Chad, the 
                        population declined from 400,000 in 1970 to about 10,000 in 2006. 
                        The population in the Tanzanian Selous Game Reserve, once the 
                        largest of any reserve in the world, dropped from 109,000 in 1976 
                        to 13,000 in 2013. The government of Tanzania estimated that more 
                        than 85,000 elephants were lost to poaching in Tanzania between 
                        2009 and 2014, representing a 60% loss.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>In 1989, CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
                        Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) banned international trade in 
                        ivory to fight this massive illegal trade. After the ban came into 
                        force in 1990, major ivory markets were eliminated. As a result, 
                        African elephant populations experienced a decline in illegal 
                        killing, particularly where they were appropriately protected. 
                        This allowed some elephant populations to recover. Nevertheless, 
                        within countries where wildlife management authorities are greatly 
                        under-funded, poaching is still a significant problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>The World Wildlife Foundation states that the two threats that impact 
                        African elephants the most are the demand for ivory and changes in 
                        land usage. The majority of the ivory leaving Africa continues to be 
                        acquired and transported illegally, and over 80% of all the raw 
                        ivory traded comes from poached African elephants. From 2006 to 
                        2012 the magnitude of poaching increased (including some 3,000 
                        elephants slaughtered in between 2006 and 2009). In an incident 
                        lasting a few days in February 2012 in Bouba N'Djida park in 
                        Cameroon, 650 elephants were poached. In early March 2013 in Chad, 
                        86 elephants — including 33 pregnant females — were killed in 
                        "a potentially devastating blow to one of central Africa's last 
                        remaining elephant populations."By 2014 it was estimated that only 
                        50,000 elephants remained in Central Africa. The last major 
                        populations are present in Gabon and the Republic of Congo.
                    </p>
                    <p>According to the World Wildlife Fund, in 2014 the total population of 
                        African elephants was estimated to be around 700,000, and the Asian 
                        elephant population was estimated to be around 32,000. The 
                        population of African elephants in Southern Africa is large and 
                        expanding, with more than 300,000 within the region; Botswana has 
                        200,000 and Zimbabwe 80,000. Large populations of elephants are 
                        confined to well-protected areas. However, conservative estimates 
                        were that 23,000 African elephants were killed by poachers in 2013 
                        and less than 20% of the African elephant range was under formal 
                        protection. The International Union for Conservation of Nature 
                        released a report in September 2016 that estimates Africa's 
                        elephant population at 415,000. They reported that in the past 
                        decade, this is a decline of 111,000 elephants. This is reported 
                        as the worst decline in the past 25 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>Between the African elephants and the Asian elephants there is a 
                        large variance in genetics; also, within Africa the different 
                        species vary in genetics based on where they live. The two African 
                        species, Loxodonta africana and Loxodonta cyclotis, share different 
                        gene flow and have limited hybridization with each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>When examining the gene flow between the forest and savanna elephants,
                         observers look at 21 distinct locations. The evidence points to 
                         the fact that there was ancient hybridization since the species 
                         share a small amount of similar DNA.

                    <h4>Legal Status and Conservation</h4>
                    <p>Protection of African elephants is a high-profile conservation cause 
                        in many countries. In 1989, the Kenyan Wildlife Service burned a 
                        stockpile of tusks in protest against the ivory trade. However, 
                        African elephant populations can be devastated by poaching despite 
                        nominal governmental protection, and some nations permit the 
                        hunting of elephants for sport. In 2012, The New York Times 
                        reported a large upsurge in ivory poaching, with about 70% of the 
                        product flowing to China.
                    </p>
                    <p>Conflicts between elephants and a growing human population are a 
                        major issue in elephant conservation. Human encroachment into 
                        natural areas where bush elephants occur or their increasing 
                        presence in adjacent areas has spurred research into methods of 
                        safely driving groups of elephants away from humans. Playback of 
                        the recorded sounds of angry honey bees has been found to be 
                        remarkably effective at prompting elephants to flee an area. The 
                        International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) African 
                        elephant specialist group has set up a human-elephant conflict 
                        working group. They believe that different approaches are needed 
                        in different countries and regions, and so develop conservation 
                        strategies at national and regional levels.
                    </p>
                    <p>Under the auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild 
                        Animals (CMS), also known as the Bonn Convention, a Memorandum of 
                        Understanding concerning Conservation Measures for the West African 
                        Populations of the African Elephant came into effect on 22 November 
                        2005. The MoU aims to protect the West African elephant population 
                        by providing an international framework for state governments, 
                        scientists and conservation groups to collaborate in the 
                        conservation of the species and its habitat.
                    </p>
                    <p>China was the biggest market for poached ivory but announced that 
                        it would phase out the legal domestic manufacture and sale of ivory 
                        products in <time>May 2015</time>, and in September of that year, 
                        China and the U.S.A. "said they would enact a nearly complete ban on the import 
                        and export of ivory."In response Chinese consumers moved to 
                        purchasing their ivory through markets in Laos, leading conservation 
                        groups to request pressure be put on Laos to end the trade.
