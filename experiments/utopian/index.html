            <h4>Austrontan War Coming To A Close</h4>
            <p>The War in Austronta has been raging for a long time now, but
              with the revolutionaries marching on the nationalists and Old
              Utopian forces getting ever closer to Prag, the base of the
              nationalists, the dreadful seems to finally be coming to a close.
              The war started a year and a few months ago when Biel, former
              Chancellor of Old Utopia rallied the Santecs, Koranians and
              leadership from Free Toast to destroy the dangerous nationalist
              regime in Austronta. Old Utopian forces under Kilian Meisner
              attacked Austronta and began a military campaign along the
              Austrontan rivers to slowly reach the capital. Progress was slow,
              despite the Old Utopians having an army almost 20 times the size
              of the Austrontan one. Then, Austrontan revolutionaries rose up in
              regions like Ungarita, hoping to depose the nationalists and
              restore Otto to the throne. The Old Utopians switched tactics and
              launched a naval invasion of Bohmenia, the homeland of the
              nationalists and began moving to the region’s capital Prag. The
              war is nearing its end.</p>

          <h3>Old Utopia</h3>
          <article class="topic-news" id="old-utopia">
            <h4>Biel’s Funeral</h4>
            <p>Biel Salvi was elected chancellor of Old Utopia from 1800 to
              1811. Also known as the Father of the Old Utopian Revolution, he
              was unfortunately shot and killed by an assassin, who is still
              on
              the run, outside of the Kanton Inu Opera Hall during a rendition
              of a piece from the composer Otto Kiefer. The assassin was hired
              by the Partito Nazionalista or Nationalist Party. The party was
              planning a coup to overthrow the democratic regime and install a
              nationalist Dictatorship much like the one in Austronta.
              Fortunately, the coup failed and its leaders were hanged.
              Unfortunately, Biel is still dead, remaining a martyr, killed
              due
              to his democratic beliefs, victim to a tyrannical plot to
              destroy
              the Democratic regime. His body was placed in a coffin which was
              held in a horse-drawn carriage which went around Kanton Inu as
              people mourned until finally being placed on a boat which sailed
              along the Alunmus river until it finally reached Pandonus, his
              birthplace. The Duke of Pandonus, Peter I gave a speech about
              Biel
              and the coffin was then placed in the centre of the massive park
              in Pandonus, adorned with lots of flowers.</p>
